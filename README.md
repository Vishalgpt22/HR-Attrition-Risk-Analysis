# HR Attrition Risk Analysis

## 📊 Project Overview

This project performs an end-to-end HR Attrition Risk Analysis to identify 
employees who are likely to leave the organization.

Using structured query logic in MySQL, employees were categorized into 
risk levels based on promotion gaps, job roles, and other HR indicators. 
The processed data was then visualized using Tableau dashboards 
to uncover trends, risk drivers, and workforce patterns.

Key analytical objectives:

- Classify employees into risk categories (Low, Medium, High)
- Measure high-risk concentration across job roles
- Analyze the relationship between promotion delays and attrition risk
- Provide interactive dashboards for HR decision-makers

This project demonstrates practical skills in:
✔ Data Transformation using SQL Views  
✔ Risk Modeling Logic  
✔ KPI Development  
✔ Dashboard Design & Data Storytelling  
✔ End-to-End Data Analysis Workflow  

The insights generated can support proactive retention strategies 
and improve workforce planning decisions.
